mega Greetings and welcome to priyanka and Gayatri's first attempt at a project - an app that allows users to input details of a task or tasks that need to be completed. You can see a working version of the app here - https://github.com/priyankahanchate/mytaskapp

rocket What we benefitted from this exercise
Pair programming. Working together in a team has benefitted us immensely as we were able to implement solutions in depth and there was greater consistency in our problem solving techniques.

Familiarisation of the tools used. HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript  were words that we barely understood at the beginning, let alone understand their uses. Although we still have a lot to learn, we are able to put theory into practice and create something tangible, like this Task-App.

warning Challenges faced
Occasional differing opinions on how to approach an issue. We would resolve this by trying all proposed methods and agree on the most effective solution.
Final design varied significantly from the initial wireframe design as it was difficult to achieve desired goals in the limited time that was allocated for each sprint.
Required ID# of each task card to increment automatically but our code was refusing to increment it. Took us a while but we finally figured it was because of the scoping of the instantiated TaskManager class.
